Introduction
--

This is an implementation of URLNet which use TensorFlow2 - Learning a URL Representation with Deep
Learning for Malicious URL Detection https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03162

URLNet is a convolutional neural network (CNN) based model used to detect
malicious URLs. The model exploits features of URL text string at both character
and word levels.
